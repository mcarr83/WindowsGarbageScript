# WindowsGarbageScript
This script can be used for brand new computers and older. This script is run on Windows Powershell.

First version needed the path to the Downloads folder modified per computer, uninstalled a couple programs and installed or updated CCLeaner.

Second version, which was uploaded, does not need a path to be modified, updates and runs Windows Defender, uninstalls a few different programs, uninstalls and reinstalls CCleaner, runs a clean and then opens CCleaner to the registry clean up tool.
